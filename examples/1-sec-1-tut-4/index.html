    <!-- Problem: Create cards for every user in your app
    Solution-A: A simple solution is to use pure html and css approach as given below -->
    <div><b>Without React</b></div>
    <div class="person">
      <h1>Rahul Pol</h1>
      <p>Age: 32</p>
    </div>
    <div class="person">
      <h1>Pranali Pol</h1>
      <p>Age: 31</p>
    </div>

    <div><b>With React</b></div>
    <!-- Approach-B: Another approach is to create a react component that generates card for user. 
                To achieve it, we will create a div wit id app which will be replaced by react component, refer babel code below for more info -->
    <div id="app"></div>

    <script
      src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js"
      crossorigin
    ></script>
    <script
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"
      crossorigin
    ></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/babel">
      // Approach-B: Create a react component that will generate card for any person

      // It can be achieved easily by creating a function which will return custom HTML(though seems HTML its actually JSX)
      // depending on the parameters.
      // Note: props is not any random name, whenever you create Person Component with attributes the attributes are passed as object
      // which is represented as props in react component
      function Person(props) {
        return (
          <div className="person">
            <h1>{props.name}</h1>
            <p>Age: {props.age}</p>
          </div>
        );
      }

      // Now, react has created a component for person in order to show or rather render it on UI you will need to use ReactDOM.
      // It is done deliberately by react as they wanted display part separate from react component this way a component can be
      // rendered any where like on browser (if you use ReactDOM) or mobile (if you use React Native) etc.

      // following is a jsx syntax, it basically means that you are returning two Person tag which are enclosed in div
      // If you inspect the element with id app on browser you will find that app contains two person ie the code returned
      // by Person function(component).
      var app = (
        <div>
          <Person name="Rahul Pol" age="32" />
          <Person name="Pranali Pol" age="31" />
        </div>
      );

      ReactDOM.render(app, document.getElementById("app"));
    </script>
    <script src="./index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
